To validate this quest you must solve the challenge:: The first morning.. The challenge principle is detailed in the Challenge tab.

Wild Circus
Some time ago, in order to become a Wilder, we asked you to create a simple static web page, the Wild Circus. At that time, you only knew some HTML, CSS and maybe a little bit of Javascript.




It feels like a long time ago, doesn't it? It was only a few months ago!

Look how far you've come! You've since learned to develop great websites with multiple dynamic features.

Working on projects in a team is very important for your future professional career, however, sometimes, working alone allows you to better reflect on your progress. That's why we are giving you the opportunity to work on a new application on your own. And you have up to 2 days to complete it.

So, let's build a new Wild Circus experience with all these new skills that you‚Äôve acquired!

You are free to design this experience as you wish, and here are some ideas to inspire you. Please note that these are only examples, not required features. So let your imagination run wild!

‚Ä¢
an administration panel to add/edit circus acts

‚Ä¢
a gallery of your fellow Wilders portrayed as circus artists

‚Ä¢
a ticket booking system

‚Ä¢
wild circus shows around you geolocation system

‚Ä¢
awesome stuff from your imagination, you are your own product owner!

Be careful though, you're limited in time so be sure to plan accordingly. You must provide something functional by the end of the time limit.

Requirements:

‚Ä¢
The site must be responsive

‚Ä¢
Data is stored in a database

‚Ä¢
Follow best practices (tests are a big plus)

‚Ä¢
The project must be available on your personal Github account

‚Ä¢
Do not forget your favorite acronyms: KISS, DRY and RTFM!

Wait, don't code right away!!!
As with any project, a good start is crucial to success.

You learned to code but you also learned to prepare. So, think before acting!

The first morning, until noon, but no more than that, perform the following tasks and present them:

‚Ä¢
write user stories (about 3 or 5)

‚Ä¢
draw a wireframe (not too many pages)

‚Ä¢
design the conceptual data model ([fr]MCD)

All of the items above should be accessible in the resources folder in your repository

(take pictures or screenshots of your drawings).

For the wireframes and data models you should try to do it on paper, unless you feel very comfortable with digital tools. Try not to waste time with an app or tool if you don‚Äôt know how it works! You can always use a good old pen and a sheet of paper.

Before coding, discuss and validate your idea with your instructor.

If your instructor takes too much time to validate your primary work, because your colleagues took them hostage, you can start coding, but, keep in mind that your application could change after your instructor‚Äôs review.

Code, code and then code
Code the features, use git branches, test your code. You know the drill.

If you get stuck, once you have tried everything (Search engines, StackOverflow, your old quests and workshops), call your instructor to the rescue via slack.
